# Bank Transaction Analyzer
 


This project is a Python application built with Tkinter that allows users to analyze and visualize their bank transactions. Users can load their CSV files containing transaction details and categorize them into specific expense categories. The application then generates visualizations, including a pie chart depicting the distribution of expenses across categories.

    CSV File Loader: Allows users to open and load CSV files containing bank transaction details.

    Expense Categorization: Automatically categorizes transactions into predefined categories like "Instant transfer in," "ATM Withdrawal," etc.

    Expense Visualization: Utilizes matplotlib to create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of expenses across different categories.

## How to Use:

    Click on "Open a File" to select and load your bank transaction CSV file.
    The application will categorize the transactions and generate a pie chart.
